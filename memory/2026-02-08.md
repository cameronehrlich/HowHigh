# HowHigh session notes (2026-02-08)

## Summary
- Implemented US-only nearby station sea level pressure calibration via NWS (`api.weather.gov`) with graceful outside-US messaging.
- Ran HowHigh on the booted iOS simulator via Xcode build/install/launch.

## Details
- Added NWS station selection + refresh UI under Profile -> Calibration.
- Persisted selected station id/name and last station calibration timestamp in SettingsStore.
- NWS implementation uses `points/{lat},{lon}` -> `observationStations` -> stations list, then `stations/{id}/observations/latest` for `seaLevelPressure` (Pa -> hPa).
- Uses explicit `User-Agent: HowHigh iOS (howhigh@37.technology)` per NWS guidance.

## Notes / Lessons
- A user-provided checklist item referenced a different repo (ColorCub). Fixed it because it was explicitly requested; otherwise stay scoped to the current workspace.
